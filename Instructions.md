Step by step:

Heat the oven to 180°C, fan 160°C, gas 4. Grease and line a 900g loaf tin with vegetable or olive oil. 
Coarsely grate the butternut squash into a mixing bowl. Crumble the feta into the bowl and sprinkle over most of the Parmesan, reserving 2 tablespoons. Tear the spinach roughly and add, along with the flour, baking powder and salt. Beat the milk and eggs together then stir into the bowl with the pepper and rosemary; lightly mix. Spoon into the tin and sprinkle over the pumpkin seeds and remaining Parmesan. Break up the extra rosemary sprig and scatter on top of the loaf. Bake for 1 hour until firm and a knife comes out cleanly.
Allow to cool for 10 minutes; remove from the tin and cool completely on a wire rack. Wrap in foil to pack.
